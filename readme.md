# Qri community files 

Default GitHub [community files](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-community-profiles-for-public-repositories) for all `qri-io` repos.

`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and `SECURITY.md` are currently global.

Issue templates, pull request templates, and `CONTRUBUTING.md` [will be written](#2) to be general and will be biased toward go code. If you have other needs for the repo you are working in, [override them](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates) with local `.github` and `CONTRUBUTING.md` for your repo.
